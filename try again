            <p>Hello, my name is John and ive recently started learning <br>
            how to code and build websites. I am interested in Frelance work</p>
            <p>Since I was young I always wanted to develop my own buisness, <br>
            my own "thing" if you will,</p>
            <p>The first thing I did was create an LLC, which gave me the ability <br>
            to legally do buisness</p>
           <p>Little did I know that was not what I needed</p>
